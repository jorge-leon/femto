ROADMAP

- Make femto.rc use fstat.
- Fix file save bug by using fmkdir.
- Improve/support batch mode: output = stdout.
- Expose envSet to Lisp and move setq from C to Lisp.
- Implement backquote and friends.
  + The reader already implements '`', ',' and ',@' as `quasiquote`, `unquote` and `splice-unquote`.
- Fix reduce, implement map, consider simplifying core functions and make them n-ary in Lisp.
- Unify stdlib into flisp.lsp.
- Implement simple repl in Lisp
  - needs getline.
  - isatty() can set an 'interactive' flag.
- Rename global argv to command-line-args, argv0 to invocation-name.
- Rename os.env to getenv.
- Make extensions plugable.
- Cleanup cerf: not so easy to do.
- Test more then one interpreter.
- ? CSP between interpreters?
- Add read and eval tracing.
- Size reduction:
  - Make double extensions optional.
  - Replace string-contains with string-search.
  - Make file extension optional.
  - Reduce binary operators to 'and' and 'xor' and write needed rest in Lisp.

fLisp 0.12
- dynamic memory allocation.
- FLISP_RESULT macros have interp as parameter.
- chunk size and initial memory allocations tuned to femto.
- all memory allocation related Note's fixed.
- optional primitive trace mechanism.
- bitwise integer operations.
- file: feof, fgets, popen, pclose, fstat, mkdir; documentation.
- Poor man's unit test framework in Lisp.

fLisp 0.11
- Showcase lisp_eval2 with (catch (fread)) mechanism.
- string search
- string-to-number in Lisp by using (read f) from a memory stream.

fLisp 0.10
- double extension
- variadic multi-typed arithmetic
- (same) primitive, (eq) in Lisp
- fold, unfold, iota

fLisp 0.9
- core uses only 64 bit integers.
- string-search in core.
- type-of
- all type predicates except null and consp in Lisp.

fLisp 0.8
- error and object types are Lisp symbols instead of C-enums.
