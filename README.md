## Documentation

Femto comes with Markdown and HTML documentation. To rebuild the
documentation [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) is required. Rebuild both
documentation formats from their respective source files by running:

	make doc

The documentation is prebuilt in this repository and can be found in

[femto.md](docs/femto.md) ([HTML](pdoc/femto.html))


## Goals of Femto Emacs

* To be an extendable version of the Atto Emacs editor using a Tiny
  Lisp extension language
* Provide a number of useful extension packages written in Tiny Lisp
  (these include an interface to **git** (similar to GNU Emacs Magit),
  a small version of **dired**, a buffer management menu (**buffer
  menu**), **defmacro** allows for a macro to be recorded and invoked
  using c-x e, and an interface to **grep**.
* Be easy to understand without extensive study (to encourage further
  experimentation).


## What does Femto bring to the party of Text Editors

As far as I know Femto is the only Emacs style editor to provide a
macro recorder that generates usable Lisp code that can then be used
to build a larger, more complex utility.  Whilst GNU Emacs has a macro
recorder facility it only allows you to dump out the keystrokes used
during macro recording.  Femto does this by writing the lisp code to a
text buffer called **macro**.  Though I have tried dozens of text
editors over the years (mostly on PCs, but a few on mini and mainframe
computers) I am not aware of any other editor that works this way.
This feature was born out of the principle of keeping a small editor
code written in C and where possible using Lisp to implement new
features.  The standard Emacs macro keystrokes [C-x (, C-c ), C-x e]
are all written in Lisp in the file examples/defmacro.lsp. This meant
that no special C code was needed in Femto to know when it was in
macro mode or not.


## Why the name Femto?

The small Emacs naming scheme appears to use sub-unit prefixes in
decending order with each further reduction of functionality. The Nano
and Pico Emacs editors have been around for a while.

* Nano means 10 to the power of minus 9
* Pico means 10 to the power of minus 12
* Femto means 10 to power of minus 15
* Atto means 10 to power of minus 18
* Zepto means 10 to the power of minus 21
* Zep is smaller version of Zepto Emacs

In Defining Atto as the lowest functional Emacs I have had to consider
the essential feature set that makes Emacs, 'Emacs'. I have defined
this point as a basic Emacs command set and key bindings; the ability
to edit multiple files (buffers), and switch between them; edit the
buffers in multiple windows, cut, copy and paste; forward and reverse
searching, a replace function and basic syntax hilighting. The proviso
being that all this will fit in less than 2000 lines of C.

Femto is an extended version of Atto Emacs with its own extension
language and less then 12.000 lines of C and Lisp.


## History

* In late 2015 Hugh Barney wrote the Atto editor 'A minimum
  functioning Emacs is less than 2000 lines of C'.  Atto was based on
  Anthony Howe's editor (commonly known as Anthony's Editor or AE,
  [2]).
* **Femto** is based on the Atto codebase [0]
* **Femto** was originally an intermediate project to form a codebase
  for the FemtoEmacs Editor [8], [9] which was a collaboration between
  Hugh Barney, Ed Costa and Lucas Guerra.  FemtoEmacs uses Jeff
  Bezanson's Femtolisp LISP [10] implementation as the basis for its
  extension language.  However the Femtolisp codebase is in excess of
  12K line of code and fairly difficult to understand how to use it
  inside an embedded application.
* In late 2016 Hugh Barney decided to look for a smaller lisp
  implementation for Femto and settled on Tiny-Lisp[7] by Mattias
  Pirstitz.
* **Zepl** was an initial project that established the suitability of
  Tiny-Lisp for use within an Emacs type editor. The results surpassed
  expectations.
* In late 2017 Hugh Barney decided to return to the **Femto** editor
  and extend it using Tiny-Lisp.
* In 2023-2026 Georg Lehner refactored the Lisp infrastructure and
  started to add additional Emacs functionality.

## Comparisons with Other Emacs Implementations

Femto has almost the same level of editor functionality as
MicroEmacs 3.10 plus a fully featured Lisp extension language for a
codebase less then half of the size.

Since femto 2.12 C code has been moved out to Lisp. The first number
in the KLOC column is the line count, the second the sloccount. The
first number in the files count are the C-files, the second number
includes the required Lisp files.

## Building

Note: this is the README for the unofficial Femto 2.25 release. All
relevant links point to the Github account `jorge-leon`, all credits
go the original author `hughbarney`.

### Build Dependencies

#### ncurses and pkgconf

Debian and Ubuntu:

Before ncurses 6 and as of Femto 1.2 you will need to install the
libcurses dev package.

	$ sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev pgkconf

Since ncurses 6:

	$ sudo apt-get install ncurses-dev pkgconf

Alpine Linux:

	$ sudo apk add ncurses-dev pkgconf

NetBSD:

	$ doas pgkin install ncurses pkgconf

FreeBSD:

	$ doas pkg install devel/ncurses pkgconf

#### fLisp

Since Femto 2.25 fLisp is split out into its own source tree so it has
to be installed separately.

From source:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/jorge-leon/flisp
cd flisp
make
sudo make install-dev
```

Or download a suitable `flisp-dev` Debian Package from
https://github.com/jorge-leon/flisp/releases and install it with

	sudo dpkg -i flisp-dev_*version*_*arch*.deb


### Build, Test and Installation

TBD branch

	$ git clone https://github.com/jorge-leon/femto.git
	$ cd femto
	$ git switch femto-fixes
	$ make femto
	$ make test
	$ sudo make install

### Packages

Prebuilt packages for Debian and Alpine Linux are
[available](https://github.com/jorge-leon/femto/releases).

Alpine Linux provides femto in the "testing" repository.


## Future Enhancements

The following enhancements are envisaged.

* Ability to load a file in read-only-mode

* Ability to setup themes of colors that can be applied to different buffers
  This will allow users to control their own colour scheme

* Pipe a buffer through a shell command and read the output back into a different buffer


## Development

See the [coding style](./style.md) guide.

Pandoc and tidy is required for doc generation.
- Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install pandoc tidy`
- Alpine: `sudo apk add pandoc-cli tidyhtml`
- NetBSD: `doas pkgin install pandoc-cli tidy`
- FreeBSD: `doas pkg install hs-pandoc tidy-html5`

There is a Doxyfile to create full cross references and call
graphs.

Usefull build targets:

- `femto`: build femto binary
- `flisp`: build fLisp binary
- `doc`: build some markdown files from Poshdoc and some html files from markdown
- `doxygen`: build the Doxygen source code documentation
- `measure`: count # of files and code lines
- `test`: run unit tests in summary mode
- `check`: run unit tests and return success if none fails
- `ftest`: call femto several times with different commandline parameters.
- `val`: run femto with valgrind. Logs are found in val.log
- `clean`: clean up build artifacts
- `deb`: build Debian package
- `install`/`uninstall`: install/uninstall locally

Make sure to run:

	make clean test
	make clean ftest
	make clean doc

before commiting code to Github.

Note: build on NetBSD and FreeBSD is currently not working.
