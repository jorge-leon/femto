+ Bump fLisp version: reason: error type symbols instead of result codes.
+ Add error type symbols to the top level environment.
+ Change to 64 bit integers.
+ Implement type-of, curry and move all type predicates except null and consp from C to Lisp.
+ Add search to string library.
+ Implement fold.
+ start a test library.
+ Move string-to-number to Lisp by using (read f) from a memory stream.
+ Fix string library.
+ Showcase lisp_eval2 with (catch (fread)) mechanism.
+ Implement fstat.
+ Implement popen, pclose.
- WIP: dynamic memory allocation
  + Run with gc_always on
  + Fix FLISP_RESULT macros: they must have interp as parameter.
  + Tune chunk size (and initial memory?)
  + Fix all related Note's.
  + Update documentation.
  - Cleanup cerf: not so easy to do
- Make femto.rc use fstat.
- Implement mkdir and fix file save bug.
- Improve/support batch mode: output = stdout.
- Expose envSet to Lisp and move setq from C to Lisp.
- Implement backquote and friends.
  + The reader already implements '`', ',' and ',@' as `quasiquote`, `unquote` and `splice-unquote`.
- Fix reduce, implement map, consider simplifying core functions and make them n-ary in Lisp.
- Unify stdlib into flisp.lsp.
- Implement simple repl in Lisp
  - needs getline.
  - isatty() can set an 'interactive' flag.
- Rename global argv to command-line-args, argv0 to invocation-name.
- Rename os.env to getenv.
- Make extensions plugable.
- Test more then one interpreter.
- ? CSP between interpreters?
- Add read and eval tracing.
- Size reduction:
  - Make double extensions optional.
  - Replace string-contains with string-search.
  - Make file extension optional.
  - Reduce binary operators to 'and' and 'xor' and write needed rest in Lisp.
